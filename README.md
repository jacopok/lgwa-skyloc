# Multibanding with LGWA

If you're here because of the QR code in the poster for [GWsNS](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/28236/), welcome! 

## Plots and code availability

- The code to generate the plots in the poster is in this repository, in 
    the folder `lgwa-sky-localization`, and the plots it generates are 
    in the folder `plots`.
- The computations make use of GWFish ([github](https://github.com/janosch314/GWFish), [documentation](https://gwfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133722000853?via%3Dihub)) for the Fisher matrix calculations.
- Also, they make use of several utilities from the package [gw-landscape](https://github.com/jacopok/gw-landscape).

## Forecasting

At the [ET Symposium](https://github.com/FrancescoIacovelli/XIII_ET_Symposium_Hackathon) I gave a general introduction to Fisher matrix forecasting, and [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FrancescoIacovelli/XIII_ET_Symposium_Hackathon/blob/main/introduction/fisher-explanation.html) you may find an outline of the information.

The sensitivity curves for the two high- and low-frequency components of ET can be found [here](https://apps.et-gw.eu/tds/?content=3&r=18213).
