## Fisher matrix forecasting for a lunar detector

The strain at the detector is in the form 
$$ h(t) = F_{ij}(t) h_{ij}(t)
$$

which can be computed in the frequency domain thanks to a Stationary Phase Approximation:

$$ h(f) = (F_+(t(f))h_+(f) F_\times (t(f)) h_\times (f)) \exp \left(
  - i \vec{r}_{\text{det}} \cdot \vec{k}(f)
  - i \frac{\pi}{4}
\right)
$$

where we need an expression for the time $t$ as a function of frequency $f$. 
We need the assumption that this is a one-to-one function (which it is not,
for example, if we account for higher order modes or eccentricity).

For the antenna patterns' variation as a function of time we do not need to care 
about
