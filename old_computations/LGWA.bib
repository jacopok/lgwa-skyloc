When data from detectors at different sites is properly combined, it will permit highly-sensitive searches for a stochastic background of relic gravitational radiation. These lectures (from the Les Houches School in October 1995) review the current status of this program, and discuss the methods by which data from different detectors can be used to make measurements of, or place limits on, a stochastic background.

  abstract = {We make forecasts for the impact a future "midband" space-based gravitational wave experiment, most sensitive to \$10\^\{-2\}- 10\$ Hz, could have on potential detections of cosmological stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). Specific proposed midband experiments considered are TianGo, B-DECIGO and AEDGE. We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve combining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the midband improves sensitivity to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at \$10\^\{-2\} - 10\$ Hz. We consider GW emission from cosmic strings and phase transitions as benchmark examples of cosmological SGWBs. We explicitly model various astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole mergers. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband experiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and LISA, significantly improve sensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from astrophysical SGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves sensitivity to cosmic string tension \$G\textbackslash mu\$ by up to a factor of \$10\$, driven by improved component separation from astrophysical sources. For phase transitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking at \$0.1 - 1\$ Hz, which for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of \$T\_*\textbackslash sim 10\^4 - 10\^6\$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA. The midband closes an energy gap and better captures characteristic spectral shape information. It thus substantially improves measurement of the properties of phase transitions at lower energies of \$T\_* \textbackslash sim O(10\^3)\$ GeV, potentially relevant to new physics at the electroweak scale, whereas in this energy range LISA alone will detect an excess but not effectively measure the phase transition parameters. Our modelling code and chains are publicly available.},

Up to now, all efforts to detect gravitational signals with seismographs have failed. Since the earth has eigenmodes with significant mass quadrupole, Weber (1967) has suggested to treat the whole earth as a detector of gravitational waves. These waves will then excite the earth's eigenvibrations by quadrupole interaction. In such a case, the cryogenic wave antenna will act simply as a superstrainmeter. The failure to detect gravitational radiation with currently available detectors means that detector sensitivity must be increased. It is expected that the cryogenic wave antenna will be improved within the next few years to make it capable to detect signals with a strength h which is approximately equal to 10 to the -20th. It is thought that signals with this strength are reaching earth from various astrophysical sources in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {The design and mechanics for a new very-low noise low frequency horizontal accelerometer is presented. The sensor has been designed to be integrated in an advanced seismic isolation system for interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The motion of a small monolithic folded-pendulum (FP) is monitored by a high resolution capacitance displacement sensor; a feedback force actuator keeps the mass at the equilibrium position. The feedback signal is proportional to the ground acceleration in the frequency range 0–150 Hz. The very high mechanical quality factor, Q ’ 3000 at a resonant frequency of 0.5 Hz, reduces the Brownian motion of the proof mass of the accelerometer below the resolution of the displacement sensor. This scheme enables the accelerometer to detect the inertial displacement of a platform with a root-mean-square noise less than 1 nm, integrated over the frequency band from 0.01 to 150 Hz. The FP geometry, combined with the monolithic design, allows the accelerometer to be extremely directional. A vertical–horizontal coupling ranging better than 10À3 has been achieved. A detailed account of the design and construction of the accelerometer is reported here. The instrument is fully ultra-high vacuum compatible and has been tested and approved for integration in seismic attenuation system of japanese TAMA 300 gravitational wave detector. The monolithic design also makes the accelerometer suitable for cryogenic operation.},

  abstract = {Double white dwarf (DWD) systems are unique among gravitational-wave sources because their evolution is governed not just by general relativity, but also by mass transfer and tides. While the black hole and neutron star binaries observed with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors are driven to inspiral due to the emission of gravitational radiation - manifesting as a ``chirp''-like gravitational-wave signal - the astrophysical processes at work in DWDs can cause the inspiral to stall and even reverse into an outspiral. The dynamics of the DWD outspiral thus encode information about tides, which tell us about the behaviour of electron-degenerate matter. We carry out a population study to determine the effect of the strength of tides on the distributions of the DWD binary parameters that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to constrain. We find that the strength of tidal coupling leaves a unique signature in the distribution of gravitational-wave frequencies and frequency derivatives for detectably mass transferring DWD systems. By measuring the population properties of DWDs, LISA will be able to probe the behavior of electron-degenerate matter.},

In this work, we first employ the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code to examine the parameter space of the progenitors of UCXBs that LISA will detect. Our simulations indicate that the initial binaries with a neutron star and a companion star, in an orbit of initial orbital period smaller than the bifurcation period, could evolve into UCXBs, some of which will emit gravitational wave signals that can be detectable by LISA. However, the initial orbital periods of the binaries that will evolve into UCXB-LISA sources in a distance of 10 kpc are located in a very narrow range, i.e., the formation of these LISA source requires an extreme fine-tuning of initial parameter. According to the characteristic strains and the derived maximum detectable distances, four sources among eight UCXBs with the observed distances are expected to be detected by LISA. Based on the parameter space given by the detailed binary evolution models and the rapid binary star evolution code, the birthrate of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources in the Galaxy is estimated to be . Considering the contribution of UCXBs in globular clusters, the number of UCXB-LISA sources can reach 240–320. Although the formation condition is severe, the detectability of UCXBs by LISA is still significant because it provides an opportunity to pursue full multi-messenger investigations.},

These will be mostly double white dwarf (DWD) binaries, and their underlying population characteristics can be directly correlated to the different properties of the Galaxy. In particular, with LISA we will be able to resolve \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^4)\$ binaries, while the rest will generate a confusion foreground signal. Both categories can be used to address a number of astrophysical questions. Analogously to how the total electromagnetic radiation emitted by a galaxy can be related to the underlying total stellar mass, in this work we propose a framework to infer the same quantity by investigating the spectral shape and amplitude of the confusion foreground signal. For a fixed DWD evolution model, we retrieve percentage-level relative errors on the total stellar mass, which improves for increasing values of the mass. At the same time, we find that variations in the Miky Way shape, at a fixed mass and at scale heights smaller than 500\textasciitilde pc, are not distinguishable based on the shape of stochastic signal alone. Finally, we utilize the catalogue of resolvable sources to probe the characteristics of the underlying population of DWD binaries. We show that the DWD frequency, coalescence time and chirp mass (up to \${$<$}0.7\textbackslash,\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$) distributions can be reconstructed from LISA data with no bias.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA’s unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial gravity fluctuations are a target of scientific studies in a variety of fields within geophysics and fundamental-physics experiments involving gravity such as the observation of gravitational waves. In geophysics, these fluctuations are typically considered as signal that carries information about processes such as fault ruptures and atmospheric density perturbations. In fundamental-physics experiments, it appears as environmental noise, which needs to be avoided or mitigated. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art of modeling high-frequency terrestrial gravity fluctuations and of gravity-noise mitigation strategies. It hereby focuses on frequencies above about 50 mHz, which allows us to simplify models of atmospheric gravity perturbations (beyond Brunt-Väisälä regime) and it guarantees as well that gravitational forces on elastic media can be treated as perturbation. Extensive studies have been carried out over the past two decades to model contributions from seismic and atmospheric fields especially by the gravitational-wave community. While terrestrial gravity fluctuations above 50 mHz have not been observed conclusively yet, sensitivity of instruments for geophysical observations and of gravitational-wave detectors is improving, and we can expect first observations in the coming years. The next challenges include the design of gravity-noise mitigation systems to be implemented in current gravitational-wave detectors, and further improvement of models for future gravitational-wave detectors where terrestrial gravity noise will play a more important role. Also, many aspects of the recent proposition to use a new generation of gravity sensors to improve real-time earthquake early-warning systems still require detailed analyses.},

  abstract = {Using Gaia DR2 data, we present an up-to-date sample of white dwarfs within 20\,pc of the Sun. In total we identified 139 systems in Gaia DR2, nine of which are new detections, with the closest of these located at a distance of 13.05\,pc. We estimated atmospheric parameters for all stellar remnants based on the Gaia parallaxes and photometry. The high precision and completeness of the Gaia astrometry allowed us to search for wide binary companions. We re-identified all known binaries where both components have accurate DR2 astrometry, and established the binarity of one of the nine newly identified white dwarfs. No new companions were found to previously known 20\,pc white dwarfs. Finally, we estimated the local white dwarf space-density to be (4.49~±~0.38) × 10−3\,pc−3, having given careful consideration to the distance-dependent Gaia completeness, which misses known objects at short distances, but is close to complete for white dwarfs near 20\,pc.},

The material evolves according to an advection-dominated accretion disk model with nuclear burning, neutrino-emissions, and disk-surface wind ejection. The extreme dynamics of the entire process has proven difficult for analytic analysis, and thus currently the properties are poorly understood. The outflows from the mergers are iron- and nickel-rich, giving rise to optical and infrared emissions powered from the decay of the radioactive iron-type isotopes, calculated via the SuperNu light-curve code. We find these systems capable of powering bright, yet short-lived, optical transients with the potential to power gamma-ray bursts.},

  abstract = {Realistic models of the Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) population are crucial for testing and quantitatively defining the science objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future European Space Agency's gravitational-wave observatory. In addition to numerous individually detectable DWDs, LISA will also detect an unresolved confusion foreground produced by the underlying Galactic population, which will affect the detectability of all LISA sources at frequencies below a few mHz. So far, the modelling of the DWD population for LISA has been based on binary population synthesis (BPS) techniques. The aim of this study is to construct an observationally driven population. To achieve this, we employ a model developed by Maoz, Hallakoun and Badenes (2018) for the statistical analysis of the local DWD population using two complementary large, multi-epoch, spectroscopic samples: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Supernova Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY). We calculate the number of LISA-detectable DWDs and the Galactic confusion foreground, based on their assumptions and results. We find that the observationally driven estimates yield 1) 2 - 5 times more individually detectable DWDs than various BPS forecasts, and 2) a significantly different shape of the DWD confusion foreground. Both results have important implications for the LISA mission. A comparison between several variations to our underlying assumptions shows that our observationally driven model is robust, and that the uncertainty on the total number of LISA-detectable DWDs is in the order of 20 per cent.},

  abstract = {We present a Fourier-domain approach to modulations and delays of gravitational wave signals, a problem which arises in two different contexts. For space-based detectors like LISA, the orbital motion of the detector introduces a time-dependency in the response of the detector, consisting of both a modulation and a varying delay. In the context of signals from precessing spinning binary systems, a useful tool for building models of the waveform consists in representing the signal as a time-dependent rotation of a quasi-non-precessing waveform. In both cases, being able to compute transfer functions for these effects directly in the Fourier domain may enable performance gains for data analysis applications by using fast frequency-domain waveforms. Our results generalize previous approaches based on the stationary phase approximation for inspiral signals, extending them by including delays and computing corrections beyond the leading order, while being applicable to the broader class of inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. In the LISA case, we find that a leading-order treatment is accurate for high-mass and low-mass signals that are chirping fast enough, with errors consistently reduced by the corrections we derived. By contrast, low-mass binary black holes, if far away from merger and slowly-chirping, cannot be handled by this formalism and we develop another approach for these systems. In the case of precessing binaries, we explore the merger-ringdown range for a handful of cases, using a simple model for the post-merger precession. We find that deviations from leading order can give large fractional errors, while affecting mainly subdominant modes and giving rise to a limited unfaithfulness in the full waveform. Including higher-order corrections consistently reduces the unfaithfulness, and we further develop an alternative approach to accurately represent post-merger features.},

  abstract = {We construct one-dimensional steady-state models of accretion discs produced by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by a neutron star (NS) or stellar mass black hole (BH). At radii r 108.5–109 cm the mid-plane density and temperature are sufficiently high to burn the initial WD material into increasingly heavier elements (e.g. Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe and Ni) at sequentially smaller radii. When the energy released by nuclear reactions is comparable to that released gravitationally, we term the disc a nuclear-dominated accretion flow (NuDAF). At small radii 107 cm iron photodisintegrates into helium and then free nuclei, and in the very innermost disc cooling by neutrinos may be efficient. At the high accretion rates of relevance ∼10−4 to 0.1 M s−1, most of the disc is radiatively inefficient and prone to outflows powered by viscous dissipation and nuclear burning. Outflow properties are calculated by requiring that material in the mid-plane be marginally bound (Bernoulli constant 0), due (in part) to cooling by matter escaping the disc. For reasonable assumptions regarding the properties of disc winds, we show that a significant fraction ( 50–80 per cent) of the total WD mass is unbound. The composition of the ejecta is predominantly O, C, Si, Mg, Ne, Fe and S [He, C, Si, S, Ar and Fe], in the case of C–O [pure He] WDs, respectively, along with a small quantity ∼10−3 to 10−2 M of radioactive 56Ni and, potentially, a trace amount of hydrogen. Depending on the pressure dependence of wind cooling, we find that the disc may be thermally unstable to nuclear burning, the likelihood of which increases for higher mass WDs. We use our results to evaluate possible electromagnetic counterparts of WD–NS/BH mergers, including optical transients powered by the radioactive decay of 56Ni and radio transients powered by the interaction of the ejecta with the interstellar medium. We address whether recently discovered subluminous Type I supernovae result from WD–NS/BH mergers. Ultimately assessing the fate of these events requires global simulations of the disc evolution, which capture the complex interplay between nuclear burning, convection and outflows.},

Tidal disruption of the secondary forms a geometrically thick disk around the WD, which subsequently accretes at highly super-Eddington rates. Analytic estimates and numerical hydrodynamical simulations reveal that outflows from the accretion flow unbind a large fraction {$>\sptilde$} 90\% of the secondary at velocities \textasciitilde 500-1000 km/s within days of the merger. Hydrogen recombination in the expanding ejecta powers optical transient emission lasting about a month with a luminosity {$>$} 1e38 erg/s, similar to slow classical novae and luminous red novae from ordinary stellar mergers. Over longer timescales the mass accreted by the WD undergoes hydrogen shell burning, inflating the remnant into a giant of luminosity \textasciitilde 300-5000 L\_sun, effective temperature T\_eff \textasciitilde{} 3000 K and lifetime \textasciitilde 1e4-1e5 yr.

  abstract = {In a general metric theory of gravitation in four dimensions, six polarizations of a gravitational wave are allowed: two scalar and two vector modes, in addition to two tensor modes in general relativity. Such additional polarization modes appear due to additional degrees of freedom in modified theories of gravitation or theories with extra dimensions. Thus, observations of gravitational waves can be utilized to constrain the extended models of gravitation. In this paper, we investigate detectability of additional polarization modes of gravitational waves, particularly focusing on a stochastic gravitational-wave background, with laser-interferometric detectors on the Earth. We found that multiple detectors can separate the mixture of polarization modes in detector outputs, and that they have almost the same sensitivity to each polarization mode of stochastic gravitational-wave background.},

  abstract = {Double white dwarf binaries with merger time-scales smaller than the Hubble time and with a total mass near the Chandrasekhar limit (i.e. classical Chandrasekhar population) or with high-mass primaries (i.e. sub-Chandrasekhar population) are potential supernova Type Ia (SNIa) progenitors. However, we have not yet unambiguously confirmed the existence of these objects observationally, a fact that has been often used to criticize the relevance of double white dwarfs for producing SNIa. We analyse whether this lack of detections is due to observational effects. To that end we simulate the double white dwarf binary population in the Galaxy and obtain synthetic spectra for the SNIa progenitors. We demonstrate that their identification, based on the detection of Hα double-lined profiles arising from the two white dwarfs in the synthetic spectra, is extremely challenging due to their intrinsic faintness. This translates into an observational probability of finding double white dwarf SNIa progenitors in the Galaxy of (2.1 ± 1.0) × 10-5 and (0.8 ± 0.4) × 10-5 for the classical Chandrasekhar and the sub-Chandrasekhar progenitor populations, respectively. Eclipsing double white dwarf SNIa progenitors are found to suffer from the same observational effect. The next generation of large-aperture telescopes is expected to help in increasing the probability for detection by ∼1 order of magnitude. However, it is only with forthcoming observations such as those provided by LISA that we expect to unambiguously confirm or disprove the existence of double white dwarf SNIa progenitors and to test their importance for producing SNIa.},

  abstract = {The Einstein Telescope (ET) is going to bring a revolution for the future of multi-messenger astrophysics. In order to detect the counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers at high redshift, the high-energy observations will play a crucial role. Here, we explore the perspectives of ET, as single observatory and in a network of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, operating in synergy with future \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray and X-ray satellites. We predict the high-energy emission of BNS mergers and its detectability in a theoretical framework which is able to reproduce the properties of the current sample of observed short GRBs (SGRB). We estimate the joint GW and high-energy detection rate for both the prompt and afterglow emissions, testing several combinations of instruments and observational strategies. We find that the vast majority of SGRBs detected in \$\textbackslash gamma\$-rays will have a detectable GW counterpart; the joint detection efficiency approaches \$100\textbackslash\%\$ considering a network of third generation GW observatories. The probability of identifying the electromagnetic counterpart of BNS mergers is significantly enhanced if the sky localisation provided by GW instruments is observed by wide field X-ray monitors. We emphasize that the role of the future X-ray observatories will be very crucial for the detection of the fainter emission outside the jet core, which will allow us to probe the yet unexplored population of low-luminosity SGRBs in the nearby Universe, as well as to unveil the nature of the jet structure and the connections with the progenitor properties.},

  abstract = {A type Ia supernova is thought to begin with the explosion of a white dwarf star. The explosion could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs (a `double-degenerate' origin), or by mass transfer from a companion star (the `single-degenerate' path). The identity of the progenitor is still controversial; for example, a recent argument against the single-degenerate origin has been widely rejected. One way to distinguish between the double- and single-degenerate progenitors is to look at the centre of a known type Ia supernova remnant to see whether any former companion star is present. A likely ex-companion star for the progenitor of the supernova observed by Tycho Brahe has been identified, but that claim is still controversial. Here we report that the central region of the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the site of a type Ia supernova 400 +/- 50 years ago, based on its light echo) in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains no ex-companion star to a visual magnitude limit of 26.9 (an absolute magnitude of MV = +8.4) within a region of radius 1.43 arcseconds. (This corresponds to the 3σ maximum distance to which a companion could have been `kicked' by the explosion.) This lack of any ex-companion star to deep limits rules out all published single-degenerate models for this supernova. The only remaining possibility is that the progenitor of this particular type Ia supernova was a double-degenerate system.},

  abstract = {The gravitational-wave astronomical revolution began in 2015 with LIGO’s observation of the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. Over the coming decades, ground-based detectors like laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO), Virgo and KAGRA will extend their reach, discovering thousands of stellar-mass binaries. In the 2030s, the space-based laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) will enable gravitational-wave observations of the massive black holes in galactic centres. Between ground-based observatories and LISA lies the unexplored dHz gravitational-wave frequency band. Here, we show the potential of a decihertz observatory (DO) which could cover this band, and complement discoveries made by other gravitational-wave observatories. The dHz range is uniquely suited to observation of intermediate-mass (∼102–104 M ⊙) black holes, which may form the missing link between stellar-mass and massive black holes, offering an opportunity to measure their properties. DOs will be able to detect stellar-mass binaries days to years before they merge and are observed by ground-based detectors, providing early warning of nearby binary neutron star mergers, and enabling measurements of the eccentricity of binary black holes, providing revealing insights into their formation. Observing dHz gravitational-waves also opens the possibility of testing fundamental physics in a new laboratory, permitting unique tests of general relativity (GR) and the standard model of particle physics. Overall, a DO would answer outstanding questions about how black holes form and evolve across cosmic time, open new avenues for multimessenger astronomy, and advance our understanding of gravitation, particle physics and cosmology.},

This measurement will thus help us to deepen our understanding on the strongly interacting exotic objects.

In particular, the multiplicity of WDs contains information regarding the formation and evolution of binary systems. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Can we understand the multiplicity of the local WD sample from a theoretical point of view? Population synthesis methods are often applied to estimate stellar space densities and event rates, but how well are these estimates calibrated? This can be tested by a comparison with the 20 pc sample, which contains ≃100 stars and is minimally affected by selection biases. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We model the formation and evolution of single stars and binaries within 20 pc with a population synthesis approach. We construct a model of the current sample of WDs and differentiate between WDs in different configurations, that is single WDs, and resolved and unresolved binaries containing a WD with either a main-sequence (MS) component or with a second WD. We also study the effect of different assumptions concerning the star formation history, binary evolution, and the initial distributions of binary parameters. We compile from the literature the available information on the sample of WDs within 20 pc, with a particular emphasis on their multiplicity, and compare this to the synthetic models. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The observed space densities of single and binary WDs are well reproduced by the models. The space densities of the most common WD systems (single WDs and unresolved WD-MS binaries) are consistent within a factor two with the observed value. We find a discrepancy only for the space density of resolved double WDs. We exclude that observational selection effects, fast stellar winds, or dynamical interactions with other objects in the Milky Way explain this discrepancy. We find that either the initial mass ratio distribution in the solar neighbourhood is biased towards low mass-ratios, or more than ten resolved DWDs have been missed observationally in the 20 pc sample. Furthermore, we show that the low binary fraction of WD systems ( 25\%) compared to solar-type MS-MS binaries ( 50\%) is consistent with theory, and is mainly caused by mergers in binary systems, and to a lesser degree by WDs hiding in the glare of their companion stars. Lastly, Gaia will dramatically increase the size of the volume-limited WD sample, detecting the coolest and oldest WDs out to ≃50 pc. We provide a detailed estimate of the number of single and binary WDs in the Gaia sample.},
