  abstract = {We make forecasts for the impact a future "midband" space-based gravitational wave experiment, most sensitive to \$10\^\{-2\}- 10\$ Hz, could have on potential detections of cosmological stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). Specific proposed midband experiments considered are TianGo, B-DECIGO and AEDGE. We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve combining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the midband improves sensitivity to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at \$10\^\{-2\} - 10\$ Hz. We consider GW emission from cosmic strings and phase transitions as benchmark examples of cosmological SGWBs. We explicitly model various astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole mergers. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband experiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and LISA, significantly improve sensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from astrophysical SGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves sensitivity to cosmic string tension \$G\textbackslash mu\$ by up to a factor of \$10\$, driven by improved component separation from astrophysical sources. For phase transitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking at \$0.1 - 1\$ Hz, which for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of \$T\_*\textbackslash sim 10\^4 - 10\^6\$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA. The midband closes an energy gap and better captures characteristic spectral shape information. It thus substantially improves measurement of the properties of phase transitions at lower energies of \$T\_* \textbackslash sim O(10\^3)\$ GeV, potentially relevant to new physics at the electroweak scale, whereas in this energy range LISA alone will detect an excess but not effectively measure the phase transition parameters. Our modelling code and chains are publicly available.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades, attempts have been made to detect gravitational radiation by means of seismographs, cryogenic gravity meters, and Weber wave antennas. Up to now, all efforts to detect gravitational signals with seismographs have failed. Since the earth has eigenmodes with significant mass quadrupole, Weber (1967) has suggested to treat the whole earth as a detector of gravitational waves. These waves will then excite the earth's eigenvibrations by quadrupole interaction. In such a case, the cryogenic wave antenna will act simply as a superstrainmeter. The failure to detect gravitational radiation with currently available detectors means that detector sensitivity must be increased. It is expected that the cryogenic wave antenna will be improved within the next few years to make it capable to detect signals with a strength h which is approximately equal to 10 to the -20th. It is thought that signals with this strength are reaching earth from various astrophysical sources in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Double white dwarf (DWD) systems are unique among gravitational-wave sources because their evolution is governed not just by general relativity, but also by mass transfer and tides. While the black hole and neutron star binaries observed with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors are driven to inspiral due to the emission of gravitational radiation - manifesting as a ``chirp''-like gravitational-wave signal - the astrophysical processes at work in DWDs can cause the inspiral to stall and even reverse into an outspiral. The dynamics of the DWD outspiral thus encode information about tides, which tell us about the behaviour of electron-degenerate matter. We carry out a population study to determine the effect of the strength of tides on the distributions of the DWD binary parameters that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to constrain. We find that the strength of tidal coupling leaves a unique signature in the distribution of gravitational-wave frequencies and frequency derivatives for detectably mass transferring DWD systems. By measuring the population properties of DWDs, LISA will be able to probe the behavior of electron-degenerate matter.},

  abstract = {Future gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be able to resolve a significant number of the ultra compact stellar-mass binaries in our own Galaxy and its neighborhood. These will be mostly double white dwarf (DWD) binaries, and their underlying population characteristics can be directly correlated to the different properties of the Galaxy. In particular, with LISA we will be able to resolve \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^4)\$ binaries, while the rest will generate a confusion foreground signal. Both categories can be used to address a number of astrophysical questions. Analogously to how the total electromagnetic radiation emitted by a galaxy can be related to the underlying total stellar mass, in this work we propose a framework to infer the same quantity by investigating the spectral shape and amplitude of the confusion foreground signal. For a fixed DWD evolution model, we retrieve percentage-level relative errors on the total stellar mass, which improves for increasing values of the mass. At the same time, we find that variations in the Miky Way shape, at a fixed mass and at scale heights smaller than 500\textasciitilde pc, are not distinguishable based on the shape of stochastic signal alone. Finally, we utilize the catalogue of resolvable sources to probe the characteristics of the underlying population of DWD binaries. We show that the DWD frequency, coalescence time and chirp mass (up to \${$<$}0.7\textbackslash,\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$) distributions can be reconstructed from LISA data with no bias.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA’s unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.},

During an assumed 4-year mission time for decihertz GW observatories, we find that for the goals of electromagnetic follow-ups, DO-Optimal performs better than B-DECIGO as a whole on the detection rate, and has a larger detectable distance for joint sGRB/kilonova searches.

  abstract = {Realistic models of the Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) population are crucial for testing and quantitatively defining the science objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future European Space Agency's gravitational-wave observatory. In addition to numerous individually detectable DWDs, LISA will also detect an unresolved confusion foreground produced by the underlying Galactic population, which will affect the detectability of all LISA sources at frequencies below a few mHz. So far, the modelling of the DWD population for LISA has been based on binary population synthesis (BPS) techniques. The aim of this study is to construct an observationally driven population. To achieve this, we employ a model developed by Maoz, Hallakoun and Badenes (2018) for the statistical analysis of the local DWD population using two complementary large, multi-epoch, spectroscopic samples: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Supernova Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY). We calculate the number of LISA-detectable DWDs and the Galactic confusion foreground, based on their assumptions and results. We find that the observationally driven estimates yield 1) 2 - 5 times more individually detectable DWDs than various BPS forecasts, and 2) a significantly different shape of the DWD confusion foreground. Both results have important implications for the LISA mission. A comparison between several variations to our underlying assumptions shows that our observationally driven model is robust, and that the uncertainty on the total number of LISA-detectable DWDs is in the order of 20 per cent.},

  abstract = {We present a Fourier-domain approach to modulations and delays of gravitational wave signals, a problem which arises in two different contexts. For space-based detectors like LISA, the orbital motion of the detector introduces a time-dependency in the response of the detector, consisting of both a modulation and a varying delay. In the context of signals from precessing spinning binary systems, a useful tool for building models of the waveform consists in representing the signal as a time-dependent rotation of a quasi-non-precessing waveform. In both cases, being able to compute transfer functions for these effects directly in the Fourier domain may enable performance gains for data analysis applications by using fast frequency-domain waveforms. Our results generalize previous approaches based on the stationary phase approximation for inspiral signals, extending them by including delays and computing corrections beyond the leading order, while being applicable to the broader class of inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. In the LISA case, we find that a leading-order treatment is accurate for high-mass and low-mass signals that are chirping fast enough, with errors consistently reduced by the corrections we derived. By contrast, low-mass binary black holes, if far away from merger and slowly-chirping, cannot be handled by this formalism and we develop another approach for these systems. In the case of precessing binaries, we explore the merger-ringdown range for a handful of cases, using a simple model for the post-merger precession. We find that deviations from leading order can give large fractional errors, while affecting mainly subdominant modes and giving rise to a limited unfaithfulness in the full waveform. Including higher-order corrections consistently reduces the unfaithfulness, and we further develop an alternative approach to accurately represent post-merger features.},

  abstract = {We review the properties of Galactic binaries containing two compact objects, as derived by means of population synthesis. Using this information we calculate the gravitational wave signal of these binaries. At frequencies below f \&lt;\textasciitilde{} 2 mHz the double white dwarf population forms an unresolved background for the low-frequency gravitational wave detector LISA. Above this limit some few thousand double white dwarfs and few tens of binaries containing neutron stars will be resolved. Of the resolved double white dwarfs \textasciitilde{} 500 have a total mass above the Chandrasekhar limit. About \textasciitilde{} 95 of these have a measurable frequency change allowing a determination of their chirp mass. We discuss the properties of the resolved systems.},

  abstract = {Double white dwarf binaries with merger time-scales smaller than the Hubble time and with a total mass near the Chandrasekhar limit (i.e. classical Chandrasekhar population) or with high-mass primaries (i.e. sub-Chandrasekhar population) are potential supernova Type Ia (SNIa) progenitors. However, we have not yet unambiguously confirmed the existence of these objects observationally, a fact that has been often used to criticize the relevance of double white dwarfs for producing SNIa. We analyse whether this lack of detections is due to observational effects. To that end we simulate the double white dwarf binary population in the Galaxy and obtain synthetic spectra for the SNIa progenitors. We demonstrate that their identification, based on the detection of Hα double-lined profiles arising from the two white dwarfs in the synthetic spectra, is extremely challenging due to their intrinsic faintness. This translates into an observational probability of finding double white dwarf SNIa progenitors in the Galaxy of (2.1 ± 1.0) × 10-5 and (0.8 ± 0.4) × 10-5 for the classical Chandrasekhar and the sub-Chandrasekhar progenitor populations, respectively. Eclipsing double white dwarf SNIa progenitors are found to suffer from the same observational effect. The next generation of large-aperture telescopes is expected to help in increasing the probability for detection by ∼1 order of magnitude. However, it is only with forthcoming observations such as those provided by LISA that we expect to unambiguously confirm or disprove the existence of double white dwarf SNIa progenitors and to test their importance for producing SNIa.},

  abstract = {The space gravitational wave detector LISA is expected to detect \$\textbackslash sim10\^4\$ of nearly monochromatic binaries, after \$\textbackslash sim 10\$\textbackslash.yr operation. We propose to measure the inspiral/outspiral binary fluxes in the frequency space, by processing tiny frequency drifts of these numerous binaries. Rich astrophysical information is encoded in the frequency dependencies of the two fluxes, and we can read the long-term evolution of white dwarf binaries, resulting in metamorphoses or disappearances. This measurement will thus help us to deepen our understanding on the strongly interacting exotic objects. Using a simplified model for the frequency drift speeds, we discuss the primary aspects of the flux measurement, including the prospects with LISA.},

  abstract = {Context. As endpoints of stellar evolution, white dwarfs (WDs) are powerful tools to study the evolutionary history of the Galaxy. In particular, the multiplicity of WDs contains information regarding the formation and evolution of binary systems. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Can we understand the multiplicity of the local WD sample from a theoretical point of view? Population synthesis methods are often applied to estimate stellar space densities and event rates, but how well are these estimates calibrated? This can be tested by a comparison with the 20 pc sample, which contains ≃100 stars and is minimally affected by selection biases. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We model the formation and evolution of single stars and binaries within 20 pc with a population synthesis approach. We construct a model of the current sample of WDs and differentiate between WDs in different configurations, that is single WDs, and resolved and unresolved binaries containing a WD with either a main-sequence (MS) component or with a second WD. We also study the effect of different assumptions concerning the star formation history, binary evolution, and the initial distributions of binary parameters. We compile from the literature the available information on the sample of WDs within 20 pc, with a particular emphasis on their multiplicity, and compare this to the synthetic models. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The observed space densities of single and binary WDs are well reproduced by the models. The space densities of the most common WD systems (single WDs and unresolved WD-MS binaries) are consistent within a factor two with the observed value. We find a discrepancy only for the space density of resolved double WDs. We exclude that observational selection effects, fast stellar winds, or dynamical interactions with other objects in the Milky Way explain this discrepancy. We find that either the initial mass ratio distribution in the solar neighbourhood is biased towards low mass-ratios, or more than ten resolved DWDs have been missed observationally in the 20 pc sample. Furthermore, we show that the low binary fraction of WD systems ( 25\%) compared to solar-type MS-MS binaries ( 50\%) is consistent with theory, and is mainly caused by mergers in binary systems, and to a lesser degree by WDs hiding in the glare of their companion stars. Lastly, Gaia will dramatically increase the size of the volume-limited WD sample, detecting the coolest and oldest WDs out to ≃50 pc. We provide a detailed estimate of the number of single and binary WDs in the Gaia sample.},
